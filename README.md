# messapp

Messapp is a simple messaging app that allows anyone to post, retrieve and delete messages. Messapp can also check if words or phrases are [palindromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome). You can use messapp in two ways, either by calling the REST APIs or interacting via the UI.

Messapp is built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). 

## Getting started
Download and install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center). ** MongoDB needs to be started before starting the app server **.

Run the following command to install dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```
You can start the NodeJS server by executing:
```shell
npm start
```
Or to start the server in debug mode:
```shell
npm run start:debug
```
To open the UI, navigate to `http://localhost:80/` in your browser.
